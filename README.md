# MyWebsite
I wanted to create a website using stuff that I found interesting. As of now, that includes React/Redux.

Some of the things that I am interested in learning:
- Using Service Workers or Redux Offline to allow the app to function with offline capabilites
- Drag and drop functionality
- Using React Hooks throughout the whole project alleviating the use of classes
- Focus on using functional programming if I feel the need to use lodash I am going to try to use ramda
